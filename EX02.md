# STEP ONE: 

### PET-AND-OWNER (PetName, PetType, PetBreed, PetDOB, OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerPhone, OwnerEmail) 

## Functional Dependencies 
### PetName (PetType, PetBreed, PetDOB, OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerPhone, OwnerEmail) 

### OwnerEmail (OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerPhone) 

### OwnerPhone (OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerEmail) 

## PET-AND-OWNER Candidate Keys PetName 

## Is every determinant a candidate key ?
### No – OwnerEmail and OwnPhone are NOT candidate keys.

# STEP TWO 

### Break into two relations: OWNER and PET 
### OWNER (OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerPhone, OwnerEmail) 
### PET (PetName, PetType, PetBreed, PetDOB, {Foreign Key}) 

## Functional Dependencies: 
### OwnerEmail - (OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerPhone) 
### OwnerPhone - (OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerEmail) 

## OWNER Candidate Keys: OwnerPhone, OwnerEmail 

## Is every determinant a candidate key? 
### YES—OwnerEmail and OwnerPhone are candidate keys—Normalization complete! 

# STEP Three 

### We can choose either candidate key as primary key. 
### (A) IF WE USE OwnerPhone as primary key, THEN: 

### OWNER (OwnerPhone, OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerEmail) 

### PET (PetName, PetType, PetBreed, PetDOB, OwnerPhone) 

## Functional Dependencies: 
### PetName (PetType, PetBreed, PetDOB, OwnerPhone) 

### PET Candidate Keys: PetName 

## Is every determinant a candidate key? 
### YES—PetName is a candidate key—Normalization complete! 

### (B) IF WE USE OwnerEmail as primary key, THEN: 

### OWNER (OwnerPhone, OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerEmail) 
### PET (PetName, PetType, PetBreed, PetDOB, OwnerEmail) 

## Functional Dependencies: 
### PetName - (PetType, PetBreed, PetDOB, OwnerEmail) 

## PET Candidate Keys: PetName 

# STEP Four  

## FINAL NORMALIZED REALTIONS: 
### OWNER (OwnerPhone, OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerEmail) 
### PET (PetName, PetType, PetBreed, PetDOB, OwnerEmail)
